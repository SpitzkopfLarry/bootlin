# Bootlin Labs
Here you can find some projects developed using or based on. <br>
All projects are done with **Linux Ubuntu 22.04** as the host environment <br>
and run on the **STM32MP157F-DK2** development board.

Most Bootlin Labs state they support any STM32MP1* development board. But in practice, it's not always that straightforward. <br>
If you're using the STM32MP157F-DK2, you may find some helpful fixes or workarounds for common issues right here in this repository.
